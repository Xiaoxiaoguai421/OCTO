	a foolish boy:
		学车碰到的教练很魔性，一直说我学的好，可是我确实不太会啊，他是不是想早下班才这样说的；
		今天，我收到了第一个青轴键盘，打字有点费劲，还不熟练；
	wild heart:
		It's delighted to say GOOD NIGHT to my lass at 23:00 every day.
		It is true that I love you now,not just like you.
	dear lass:
		The team to investigate silkworm in Anhui province was successfully approved as a scholastic project.
		I am looking forword to your better show,my dear.

    a hapless boy:
		Yes,It never rains but it pours.I did skip classes in the morning for practice driving.And I was sleepy 
		extremely in English class when I answered the questions.What made me mad is that I was forced to deal
		with something form about Boli college,and I failed upsettingly. 
		Now,at 23:00, after saying GOOD NIGHT I am worried about my homework as well as driving exam tomorrow.
	dear lass:
		She drew a beautiful newspaper hand on Monther's Day. I miss you my lady!
